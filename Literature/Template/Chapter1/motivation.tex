\section{Motivation}

In my first year at university I was introduced to the notion of a formal language of logic, I found the idea of being able to communicate ideas and formulate arguments in a formal and rigorous manner very appealing. Learning to understand what the symbols meant, how they fitted together and reasoning within the language is not, however, a trivial task. The aim is to produce a tool that would ease the transition of the user as they attempt to familiarise themselves with a language which is very different from any natural languages they may have experience with. 

As with learning any other language, participation and practice are key factors in the learning process. That is why I set out to create an application that will give the user freedom to explore the language and deductive system themselves, while also providing feedback that will help guide them in this activity.
