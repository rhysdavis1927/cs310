\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

I would like to thank my supervisor Dr Ranko Lazic, firstly, for the teaching and materials of CS242 Formal Specification and Verification on which this project is based and secondly for the support and feedback given throughout this project. 
I would also like to thank Dr Matthew Leeke who created the \LaTeX template which was used as a starting point for this report.
