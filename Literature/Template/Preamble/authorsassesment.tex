\section{Author's assessment of the project}

\subsubsection*{What is the technical contribution of this project?}

\noindent This project involved a substantial software development undertaking in which a mobile phone application for the Android operating system was developed from scratch. Prominent challenges of this included creating a user friendly user interface and the suitable use and creation of data structures to store and manipulate data. Additional technical challenges include creating a parser for the language of FOL using the parser generator JavaCC  and coding the rules of inference in the Java programming language.
\subsubsection*{Why should this contribution be considered either relevant or important to Computer Science / Discrete Mathematics?}
The contribution is relevant to both Computer Science and Discrete Mathematics because the main function of this project function is as a teaching tool for Logic, which is an area of particular interest by researchers in both fields.
In addition to this, the mobile application development aspect is an increasingly popular field in computer science.

\subsubsection*{How can others make use of the work in this project?}
Teachers of FOL will be able to make use of this tool by using it as a way to get students to participate and attempt proofs individually. The feedback from the tool will help guide the student and correct mistakes allowing the teacher to focus on helping students with the creative aspect of a proof. The opportunity to work independently on creating proofs at their own pace will help students to gain confidence in constructing proofs.
Due to the modularity of the code written parts of the system can be re-used in other systems that may expand on the work achieved in this project.

\subsubsection*{Why should this project be considered an achievement?}

\noindent The projects objectives were all successfully completed. The end result is fast and makes efficient use of memory. Feedback from users was positive indicating that the system is both easy to use and fit for purpose. Extensive testing means that the system is robust and handles incorrect input in an appropriate manner.

\subsubsection*{What are the weaknesses of this project?}

\noindent While the system achieved it's objectives the scope of the project is not particularly wide. To increase the usefulness of this project additional features would need to be added. As the project stands it is not possible to set goals for the student to reach and has no component that teaches about the use of models and environments in FOL.
