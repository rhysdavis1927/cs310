The purpose of this project was to create an application that will facilitate the learning of a particular language of symbolic logic, known as first order logic and the system of natural deduction that goes with it. An Android application was created which: allows the user to experiment with the formulation of sentences of first order logic, evaluates theses sentences and assists in the construction of proofs using natural deduction. This report details the research carried out, the design and the development the Android application.
